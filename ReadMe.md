## Introduction

**Poll Position!** is a collaborative board game for 2-4 players. In this game, players help each other organizing a Federal General Election in Canada.
As electors show up to vote, players must be sure that there are enough polling sites and that these are adequately staffed. 
If they fail to do so, the result would be long queue lines, complaints to the media, and eventually less trust in the electoral process.

_You, the players, must save democracy and keep the people happy!_

## Game contents

- One playing board
- 17 *Event* cards
- 70 *Voters* tokens, numbered 1 to 4 (1: 20x, 2: 20x, 3: 20x, 4: 10x)
- 1 special dice, with coloured sides
- 50 regular dice, numbered 1 to 6
- 7 *Specialist* cards 
- 5 Player markers, of different colors
- 1 *Voter Engagement* marker
- 1 *Reconcilliation* marker
- 1 *Forest Fires* marker
- 1 *Flash Floods* marker
- 1 *Quarantine* marker
- 1 *Personnel Shortage* marker
- 1 *CEO* marker

### The game board

The game board represents 16 electoral *Districts* of Canada, spread over 6 *Regions*:

1. Maritimes
2. Quebec
3. Ontario
4. Prairies
5. British Columbia
6. Territories

The *Districts* are of three types:

- Urban, marked by a purple circle.
- Rural, marked by a red circle.
- Remote, marked by a green circle.

Each *Region* has three districts, one for each type. The only exception is *Territories*, which has one single *Remote* district. 

On the game board here is also one special additional area, labelled *Headquarters* (or, in short, *HQ*).

At the bottom of the game board there are also six empty spaces which will be used to hold event cards.

At the top right of the table there is also a *Voter Engagement Track* with six spaces, numbered 0 to 5.


### Setting up the game

Mix up all the *Voters* tokens, with the numbers facing down. Then, without looking at the numbers, place one token on each district, and one token on *HQ*.

Take 17 dice, and place one of them on each district and the *HQ*. The dice must show the number '1' facing up.

Shuffle the *Event* cards and, without looking, place them face down on the six empty spaces at the bottom of the table.

Place the *Voter Engagement* marker on the place labelled "0" of the *Voter Engagement Track*.

Give the *CEO* token to the player who has voted in most elections (no matter which country, counting also referendums). 
Alternatively, give the *CEO* token to the oldest player. 

Finally, shuffle the *Specialist* cards and give one to each player. These cards can (and should) be shown and discussed with other players.
Each player then collects the player marker with the same color (or symbol) of the *Specialist* card they received.

## Game phases

The game develops over five rounds, known as *Campaign Weeks*. Each of them is composed of the following phases:

1. The *Planning* phase.
2. The *Events* phase.
3. The *Actions* phase.
4. The *Handover* phase.

On phases 1, 2, and 4 all players play simultaneously. On phase 3, players play in turn, starting from the CEO and proceeding clockwise.
At the end of the game, a special *Scoring* phase takes place.

### The *Planning* phase

During the planning phase, the players discuss on how to best place their player markers, according to the unfolding situation on the game board, trying to prevent bad outcomes from the *Event* cards.
Each player marker can be placed in one of the six *Regions*; for Regions with more than one *District*, the player markers are understood to be active on all Districts, so the player marker does not need to be placed on a specific District.
No player markers can ever be placed on the *Headquarters* space. 

For winning the game, it is best for all players to reach a consensus on where to place the player markers; each player, however, is allowed to disregrard other players' opinions and place their own player marker as they wish. The *CEO* does not yield any authority in this respect.

Once all players have placed theirs player markers, they move on to the *Events* phase.

### The *Events* phase

At the beginning of the *Events* phase, the *CEO* reveals the leftmost covered *Event* card at the bottom of the game board. 
The *CEO* then reads the contents of the card and follows the instruction, adding voter tokens or removing *Polling Sites* as indicated.
If an *Event* card has a "+1" yellow marker, then the *Voter Engagement* marker is moved one space to the right on the *Voter Engagement Track*.
When all the effects of the *Event* cards have been recorded on the board, the game moves to the *Actions* phase.

### The *Actions* phase

In the *Actions* phase, the players play in turn, starting from the *CEO* and proceeding clockwise. Each player has access to the following actions:

- **Open a new Polling Site:** the player places a die, with the number "1" face up, in one of the *Districts* in the same *Region* as their player marker. They can perform the same action on the *Headquarters*, no matter where the player marker is located.
- **Staff an existing Polling Site:** the player takes one die and rolls it. Then, they can choose to replace with the rolled die one of the *Polling Sites* (die) in one of the *Districts* in the same *Region* as their player marker, number facing up.  They can perform the same action on the *Headquarters*, no matter where the player marker is located.
- **Reach Out:** without revealing its value, the player moves one voter token from one of the *Districts* in the same *Region* as their player marker, to the *Headquarters* space. This action is not allowed during the last *Campaign Week*.

Each player has 4 *Action Points* available, that can be spent to perform the actions listed above. The actions have different costs:

- **1 Action Point:** *Reach Out*; *Staff an existing Polling Site* (anywhere); *Open a new Polling Site* (*Urban Districts* and *Headquarters*).
- **2 Action Points:** *Open a new Polling Site* (*Rural Districts*).
- **3 Action Points:** *Open a new Polling Site* (*Remote Districts*).

A player can decide to spend less than the 3 allocated *Action Points*. Unused *Action Points* can neither be transferred between players, nor saved for a later *Campaign Week*.

After a player has played all the actions they perform a number of *Voter Intention Rolls*.

*Voter Intention Rolls* are performed thusly: The player rolls two dice: a regular numbered die, and the special coloured die. 
The result of the dice roll is interpreted as following: the number indicates a *Region*, and the colour a *District* (purple: *Urban*, red: *Rural*, green: *Remote*).
The player places a voter token in the *Region* and *District* resulting from the dice roll, without showing the token value.
If the dice roll indicates a combination that is not valid (e.g. *Urban* or *Rural* district in *Territories*, or a *District* that has been removed from play by an *Event* card), then the voter token is placed at the *Headquarters* instead.

The number of *Voter Intention Rolls* performed by each player at the end of their turns depends from the position of the *Voter Engagement* marker on the *Voter Engagement Track*: 

- If the marker is on spaces 0-2, then each player performs 2 *Voter Intention Rolls* at the end of their turn.
- If the marker is on spaces 3-4, then each player performs 3 *Voter Intention Rolls* at the end of their turn.
- If the marker is on space 5, then each player performs 4 *Voter Intention Rolls* at the end of their turn.

After the *Voter Intention Rolls* have been performed, and the voter tokens placed on the game board, the play moves to the next player on the left of the current player.

_Note: Voter Intention Rolls are skipped during the 6th Campaign Week._

If all players have played and the next player on the left is the *CEO*, then the *Actions* phase is over and the game moves to the *Handover* phase.

### The *Handover* phase

During the *Handover* phase, the *CEO* gives the *CEO token* to the player to their left, who becomes the new *CEO* for the next *Campaign Week*. 
If there are no remaining *Campaign Weeks* left, then the game moves to the *Scoring* phase and the end of the game.

## The *Scoring* phase

During the *Scoring* phase, you are awarded positive and negative *Victory Points* based on three scores:

- Electoral *Turnout* awards positive *Victory Points*.
- *Complaints* award negative *Victory Points*.
- Election *Cost* awards negative *Victory Points*.

In this phase, you reveal the Voter Tokens one Region at a time, starting with the Maritimes and ending with the Territories.
Then, you follow the instructions here below to calculate *Turnout*, *Complaints* and *Cost*.

### Turnout

In each District, you add up the value of all Voter Tokens, which forms the *District Turnout*. 
You then add up the *District Turnout* in all *Regions* to obtain the final *Turnout*. 
The number of (positive) *Victory Points* awarded is equal to *Turnout* divided by 5, rounding fractions down.

### Complaints

In each District, you add up the value of all *Polling Stations* dice, which forms the *Capacity*. 
You then compare the *District Turnout* with the *Capacity*.
If the *District Turnout* is lower or equal than the *Capacity*, the number of *Complaints* for that district is 0. 
Otherwise, a number of *Complaints* equal to the difference between *District Turnout* and *Capacity* is generated.

> Example: In the Remote district of the Maritimes, there are 2 Voter Tokens with values 3 and 4. The *District Turnout* is thus 3+4=7.
> In the same district, there are 2 PS with capacity 1 and 3, for a total *Capacity* of 4. 
> Since *District Turnout* is larger than *Capacity*, this District generates 7-4=3 *Complaints*.

Add up all *Complaints* for all Districts in a Region, and then add up the complaints for all Regions.
For the *Headquarters*, follow the same rule, except that here the *Capacity* is doubled, i.e. you multiply the sum of all dice by 2 before subtracting from the *District Turnout*.

The number of (negative) *Victory Points* awarded is equal to the number of *Complaints*.

### Cost

To calculate *Cost*, add up the *Capacity* of all *Polling Station* dice, in the Regions and on HQ. 
The number of (negative) *Victory Points* awarded is equal to *Cost* divided by 10, rounding fractions down.

### Final Score  

Subtract negative *Victory Points* from positive ones, and check where how you fared on this table:

- **More than 10 Victory Points**: Congratulations! The elections were succesful and the electorate's confidence in the democratic process has been restored!
- **From 1 to 10 Victory Points**: Well done! Quiet elections, some minor complains reported on local media.
- **From 0 to -10 Victory Points**: Uh-oh. National media report of major disruptions at polling sites. The parliamentary committee is going to ask you some tough questions.
- **Less than -10 Victory Points**: Disaster! Mobs armed with pitchforks invade Parliament. Luckily, it's still closed for construction. You seek refuge in the world's last bastion of democracy, Switzerland.

_Note: In some the card effects, you may be asked to select a random Region or a random District. To select a random Region, roll a D6 and select the corresponding region.
To randomly select a district, roll both a D6 and the coloured die; the combination of colour and die number indicate the region and the district within the region. 
For an explanation of region numbers and district colours, refer to the the game board section above._

## *Specialist* cards

Each player receives at the beginning of the game a *Specialist* card, that grants the player special actions during their turn.
The special action can be combined with other regular actions during the player's turn, if the amount of Action Points spent allows it.

- *Communications Officer*: *Advertise* &mdash; each *Reach Out* action has an increased effect, allowing you to move 2 Voter Tokens to HQ. Note that the *Reach Out* action is not allowed during the last *Campaign Week*.
- *Data Analyst*: *Simulate* &mdash; Once during your turn, spend 1 Action Point to look at the Event Card from the next Campaign Week. You can show this card to other players, then place it face down where you took it.
- *Distribution Specialist*: *Distribute Material* &mdash; Placing a Polling Station in Rural and Remote districts costs 1 Action Points less. In Urban districts, you can open 2 Polling Stations for the cost of 1 Action Point.
- *Field Liaison Officer*: *Coordinate* &mdash; Once during your turn, spend 1 Action Point to perform an Action with the same benefits as another *Specialist* who is located in a neighbouring *Region*.
- *Returning Officer*: *Split & Merge* &mdash; Spend 1 Action Point to reduce the Capacity of a PS in the region you occupy by 1 (cannot be reduced to 0). Then, place a new PS in the same Region.
- *Survey Specialist*: *Survey* &mdash; Spend 1 Action Point to flip 3 Voter Tokens side up, showing its value, in the same Region as your pawn. You are not allowed to flip more than one token in each district during the same Campaign Week. These tokens stay side up for the remainder of the game, unless removed by an event card.
- *Staffing Officer*: *Recruit* &mdash; When staffing an exiting Polling Site, Roll 2 dice instead of one, then keep the highest score.
